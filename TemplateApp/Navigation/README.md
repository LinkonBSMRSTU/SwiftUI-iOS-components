# ðŸ§­ Navigation

Set of SwiftUI components that allows implementing declarative navigation between views.

Examples: Each component has corresponding `PreviewProvider` with example usage.

## ðŸ§© NavigationBackButton

Default back button that can be embedded in `NavigationBar` component. It uses `NavigationDismissAction` to trigger dismission.

```swift
NavigationBackButton()
```

- [NavigationBackButton.swift](NavigationBackButton.swift)

## ðŸ§© NavigationBar

Default navigation bar that can be embedded in `NavigationItem` component.

```swift
NavigationBar(
  title: { Text("Title") },
  leading: { Text("Leading") },
  trailing: { Text("Trailing") }
)
```

- [NavigationBar.swift](NavigationBar.swift)

## ðŸ§© NavigationForward

Allows to navigate forward from one view to another. When navigation takes place, currently visible view is removed from the hierarchy and replaced with the forwarded one. 

The component can be used by providing `Bool` value that defines if navigation is active and a closure that returns the forwarded view:

```swift
var isForwarded: Bool

RootView()
  .navigationForward(isActive: isForwarded) {
    ForwardedView()
  }
```

Or by providing a closure that returns optional forwarded view that (if not `nil`) will replace current view:

```swift
var model: Model?

struct ForwardedView: View {
  init(with model: Model) { ... }
  ...
}

RootView()
  .navigationForward {
    model.map(ForwardedView(with:))
  }
```

## ðŸ§© NavigationDismissAction

Uses SwiftUI environment to inject navigation dismiss action into view hierarchy. This environment property is used by `NavigationBackButton` and `NavigationPopGesture` to trigger dismission.

```swift
struct SomeView: View {
  @Environment(\.navigationDismissAction) var navigationDismissAction

  var body: some View {
    Button(action: { self.navigationDismissAction() }) {
      Text("Dismiss")
    }
  }
}
```

```swift
SomeView().navigationDismissAction { ... }
```

- [NavigationDismissAction.swift](NavigationDismissAction.swift)

## ðŸ§© NavigationItem

Navigation item component provides visual representation for a view with navigation bar. The bar can be hidden by injecting `EmptyView`.

```swift
NavigationItem(
  navigationBar: { EmptyView() }, 
  content: { Text("Content") }
)
```

- [NavigationItem.swift](NavigationItem.swift)

## ðŸ§© NavigationPopGesture

Adds gesture-driven dismission to a view presented using `NavigationPush` component.

```swift
RootView()
  .navigationPush(isActive: isPushed) {
    PushedView()
      .navigationPopGesture()
      .navigationDismissAction { isPushed = false }
  }
```

- [NavigationPopGesture.swift](NavigationPopGesture.swift)

## ðŸ§© NavigationPush

Allows to push a view on top of current view, imitating `UINavigationController` push action. When navigation takes place, pushed view appears on top of currently visible view, which is not removed from the view hierarchy. 

The component can be used by providing `Bool` value that defines if navigation is active and a closure that returns pushed view:

```swift
var isPushed: Bool

RootView()
  .navigationPush(isActive: isPushed) {
    PushedView()
  }
```

Or by providing a closure that returns optional view that will be pushed if it's not `nil`:

```swift
var model: Model?

struct PushedView: View {
  init(with model: Model) { ... }
  ...
}

RootView()
  .navigationPush {
    model.map(PushedView(with:))
  }
```
