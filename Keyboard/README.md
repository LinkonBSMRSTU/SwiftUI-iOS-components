# ‚å®Ô∏è Keyboard

Set of SwiftUI components for handling onscreen keyboard.

**Examples:** Each component has corresponding `PreviewProvider` with example usage. Because onscreen keyboard is not visible in Xcode previews, use simulator or physical device to check out the examples.

## üß© KeyboardAvoider

SwiftUI view modifier that ensures the view to which is applied is not covered by onscreen keyboard. The effect of "keyboard avoiding" is achieved by applying bottom padding to the view. The padding value is calculated from intersection of the view and onscreen keyboard frames. The component uses `KeyboardObserver` environment object, so make sure to inject it into view hierarchy.

```swift
let keyboard: KeyboardObserver

SomeView()
  .avoidKeyboard()
  .environmentObject(keyboard)
```

## üß© KeyboardObserver

Observable object that provides current onscreen keyboard state:

- `@Published var frame: CGRect? { get }` - Keyboard frame in global coordinate space or `nil` if keyboard is not visible.
- `@Published var animationDuration: TimeInterval { get }` - Keyboard frame animation duration (defaults to `0` if keyboard was not presented).

It also provides convenience way of dismissing the keyboard by calling `dismiss()` function.

Component can be used by adding `@ObservedObject` property to the view:

```swift
struct SomeView: View {
  @ObservedObject var keyboard = KeyboardObserver()
  ...
}
```

It's recommended to use single `KeyboardObserver` instance per view hierarchy, which can be ensured by using SwiftUI environment objects:

```swift
struct SomeView: View {
  @EnvironmentObject var keyboard: KeyboardObserver
  ...
}

let keyboard = KeyboardObserver()
let view = SomeView().environmentObject(keyboard)
```
